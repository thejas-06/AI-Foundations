# OCI Vision - Learning Notes

## Overview
This video introduces **OCI Vision**, a computer vision service that works on images. It highlights the two main capabilities of the service: **image analysis** and **document AI**. The focus is on how OCI Vision can analyze photographic images, detect and classify objects, and even retrain models with custom data.

## Key Concepts
- **OCI Vision**: A computer vision service for analyzing images.
- **Image Analysis**: Provides features such as object detection and image classification.
- **Document AI**: A capability of OCI Vision that works with documents (mentioned as a main capability).
- **Object Detection**: Detects objects within an image using bounding boxes, assigns labels, and provides accuracy percentages. It can also locate and extract text appearing in a scene (e.g., a sign).
- **Image Classification**: Assigns classification labels to an entire image by identifying its major features.
- **Model Retraining**: Beyond pretrained models, users can retrain with their own data to fit specific needs.

## Detailed Notes
- **Core Capabilities**:
  - OCI Vision works on images and provides two main capabilities:
    - **Image Analysis**
    - **Document AI**

- **Image Analysis Features**:
  - **Object Detection**:
    - Detects objects in an image.
    - Uses a **bounding box** to highlight objects.
    - Assigns a **label** to each object.
    - Provides an **accuracy percentage** for the detection.
    - Can also locate and extract **text** from the scene (e.g., text on a sign).
  - **Image Classification**:
    - Identifies the **major features** in an image.
    - Assigns **classification labels** based on the features.

- **Model Flexibility**:
  - OCI Vision offers **pretrained models**.
  - Users have the ability to **retrain models** with their own unique data.
  - Retraining allows the models to better **fit specific needs**.

## Summary
OCI Vision is a **computer vision service** that provides **image analysis** and **document AI**. Through image analysis, it enables **object detection** (with bounding boxes, labels, accuracy scores, and text extraction) and **image classification** (assigning labels based on features). Its standout capability is the option to retrain pretrained models with unique datasets, making it adaptable to specific user requirements.

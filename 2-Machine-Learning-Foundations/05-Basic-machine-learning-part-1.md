# Machine Learning Workflow Demo - Learning Notes

## Overview
This lesson demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow using **logistic regression**, a classifier. It covers the steps of loading data, preprocessing, training a model, evaluating it, and making predictions, all within a Python environment using Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Concepts
- **Machine Learning Process**: Loading data, preprocessing, training, evaluation, prediction.  
- **Classifier**: Algorithm used for classification tasks, predicting categories or labels based on input features.  
- **Logistic Regression**: A supervised learning algorithm used for classification.  
- **Features (X)**: Input attributes of data used to train the model.  
- **Labels (Y)**: Target output representing the category or class of the data.  
- **Training**: Process of teaching the model the relationship between features and labels.  
- **Prediction**: Using the trained model to determine the label of new, unseen data points.

## Detailed Notes
1. **Loading Data**  
   - Import the dataset into a pandas **DataFrame**.  
   - Inspect the data using head, info, or describe methods.  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Separate the dataset into **features (X)** and **labels (y)**.  
   - Ensure data is clean and formatted correctly for training.  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Initialize a **logistic regression classifier**.  
   - Train the model using `fit(X, y)` method.  

4. **Prediction**  
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new or sample data.  
   - Compare predicted labels with actual labels if available.  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Assess model performance by checking predictions.  
   - (Optional metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, or classification report can be used.)

- **Features (X)**: Input attributes used for training.  
- **Labels (Y)**: Output target representing class or category.  
- **Logistic Regression**: A classification algorithm used in supervised learning.  
- **Training**: Learning the relationship between features and labels.  
- **Prediction**: Determining labels for new data points.  
- **DataFrame**: Pandas data structure for tabular data.  
- **Series**: Pandas data structure for a single column or list of values.

## Summary
In this demo, we:

- Loaded the **iris dataset** into a pandas DataFrame.  
- Split the dataset into **features (X)** and **labels (y)**.  
- Created a **logistic regression classifier**.  
- Trained the model on the dataset.  
- Made predictions on sample data and printed the results.

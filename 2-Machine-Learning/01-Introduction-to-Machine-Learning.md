# Machine Learning Foundations - Learning Notes

## Overview
Hello and welcome to this module on machine learning foundations.  
In this lesson, we will learn:
- What is machine learning  
- How does it work  
- A few examples of machine learning

## Key Concepts
- **Machine Learning**: A subset of artificial intelligence focused on creating computer systems that can learn and predict outcomes from examples without explicit programming.  
- **Algorithms**: Provide intelligence to machines by automatically learning from examples, usually provided as data.  
- **Examples of Machine Learning**:  
  - Product recommendations while shopping online  
  - Movie recommendations on Netflix  
  - Spam detection in emails  
  - Self-driving cars  
- **Features**: Descriptive attributes like body color, texture, or eye color that distinguish between inputs such as cats and dogs.  
- **Labels**: The corresponding output provided for input data, such as "cat" or "dog."  
- **Training**: Process where a model learns relationships between input features and output labels.  
- **Inference**: Using a trained model to make predictions for new data points.  
- **Types of Machine Learning**:  
  - Supervised learning  
  - Unsupervised learning  
  - Reinforcement learning

## Detailed Notes  

### What is Machine Learning?  
- A subset of artificial intelligence.  
- Focuses on creating computer systems that can **learn and predict outcomes from examples** without explicit programming.  
- Powered by algorithms that learn automatically from **data**.  

### Examples of Machine Learning in Daily Life  
- **Online shopping** → Product recommendations based on preferences and shopping history.  
- **Netflix** → Movie recommendations based on viewing history and choices of other viewers.  
- **Emails** → Spam detection by classifying mail as spam or not.  
- **Self-driving cars** → Machine learning drives the car to its destination.  

### How Does Machine Learning Work?  
- Teaching a computer to differentiate between a cat and a dog:  
  - Provide **features** (e.g., body color, texture, eye color).  
  - Provide **labels** (e.g., "dog" or "cat").  
- **Input Data**: Features describing the object.  
- **Output Label**: The category assigned to the object.  
- **Training Process**:  
  - Training dataset = features + labels.  
  - Given to the model.  
  - Model learns the relationship between features and labels.  
- **Trained Model**: A model that has learned from the dataset.  
- **Inference**: Giving new input features (e.g., of a cat/dog) to predict output labels.  

### Types of Machine Learning  
1. **Supervised Learning**  
   - Uses labeled data to train the model.  
   - Model learns the relationship between features and labels.  

2. **Unsupervised Learning**  
   - Used to understand relationships within a dataset.  
   - Labels are not used or not available.  

3. **Reinforcement Learning**  
   - Algorithms learn from outcomes to make decisions or choices.  

### Real Examples of Machine Learning  

- **Supervised Learning Applications**:  
  - Disease detection  
  - Weather forecasting  
  - Stock price prediction  
  - Spam detection  
  - Credit scoring  
  - Example: Patient data is input into a model → Model predicts if the patient has a disease.  

- **Unsupervised Learning Applications**:  
  - Fraudulent transaction detection  
  - Customer segmentation  
  - Outlier detection  
  - Targeted marketing campaigns  
  - Example: Transaction data can reveal patterns leading to fraudulent transactions.  

- **Reinforcement Learning Applications**:  
  - Automated robots  
  - Autonomous driving cars  
  - Playing games

## Summary
- Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and predict outcomes.  
- It is part of our daily life: product recommendations, spam filters, Netflix suggestions, and self-driving cars.  
- Machine learning works by training models on input features and labels, which later make predictions (inference).  
- There are three main types: **Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning**.  
- Applications include disease detection, fraud detection, marketing, robotics, autonomous driving, and gaming.

# Introduction to Generative AI - Learning Notes

## Overview
This lesson introduces **Generative AI (GenAI)**, explaining how it differs from traditional **AI**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)**. It explores the working principles of generative AI, its comparison with machine learning, the types of generative AI models, and their real-world applications.

## Key Concepts
- **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The ability of machines to imitate human intelligence.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that uses algorithms to learn from past data, make predictions, or identify trends.
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: A subset of ML that uses neural networks to learn from complex data.
- **Generative AI (GenAI)**: A type of AI that creates new content such as text, images, music, videos, and more.
- **Generative AI Working Principle**: Learns underlying patterns from data and generates new data sharing those patterns.
- **Comparison with Machine Learning**: 
  - ML learns relationships between features and labels for prediction/classification.
  - GenAI learns patterns from unstructured content to generate new outputs.
- **Types of Generative AI Models**:
  - Text-based models.
  - Multimodal models.
- **Applications**: Creative content, image/video generation, medical imaging, drug discovery, and more.

## Detailed Notes

### Understanding AI, ML, and DL
- **AI**: Machines imitating human intelligence.
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms trained on past data to predict outcomes or identify trends.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural network-based learning from complex datasets.

### What is Generative AI?
- A subset of deep learning.
- Can generate **text, images, music, videos, and other data**.
- Unlocks possibilities for creativity, automation, and new ideas.

### How Generative AI Works
- Learns **underlying patterns** from datasets.
- Uses those patterns to create new, original outputs.
- Example: Teaching a GenAI model to draw dogs:
  - Train it with dog pictures.
  - Model learns features like ears, teeth, whiskers.
  - Generates a **new dog image** (not copied, but based on learned patterns).
- In practice: Involves **complex math and computation**.

### Comparison: Machine Learning vs. Generative AI
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Works with **data + labels** (supervised learning).
  - Example: Cat/dog classification with labeled images.
  - Learns relationships between input features (shape, skin texture, eye color) and output labels.
  - Produces predictions or classifications.
  - **Inference**: Using a trained model to predict outputs for new data.
- **Generative AI**:
  - Learns from **unstructured, unlabeled data**.
  - Pre-trained on unlabeled datasets.
  - Generates new data instead of labeling.
  - Can later be **fine-tuned** on labeled data for specific tasks.

### Use Case Differences
- **Traditional ML**: Used for classification and prediction.
- **GenAI**: Used for generation of text, images, and other media.

### Types of Generative AI Models
1. **Text-based models**:
   - Generate text, code, dialogues, chats, articles.
   - Trained on large text datasets to capture patterns, structures, semantics.
2. **Multimodal models**:
   - Process and generate across multiple modalities.
   - Examples: text, images, audio, video.
   - Learn from and combine multiple modalities simultaneously.

### Applications of Generative AI
- Content creation (text, images, videos).
- Medical imaging.
- Drug discovery.
- Accelerating scientific progress in medicine.
- Broad usage across industries and use cases.

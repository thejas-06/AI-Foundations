# AI vs ML vs DL - Learning Notes  

## Overview  
This module explains the difference between **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)** using simple examples. It also explores different types of machine learning such as **supervised learning**, **unsupervised learning**, and **reinforcement learning**. The module further introduces concepts like **neural networks**, **functional approximation**, and **Generative AI**.  

## Key Concepts  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Broad concept of creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence.  
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Subset of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data and make predictions or decisions.  
- **Deep Learning (DL):** Subfield of ML using deep neural networks to learn complex patterns.  
- **Supervised Learning:** Algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions or classifications.  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Algorithms discover patterns and structures in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering).  
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Agents learn through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or punishments.  
- **Neural Networks:** Layers of connected neurons used for learning and functional approximation.  
- **Functional Approximation:** Estimating a hidden function using known data.  
- **Generative AI:** Subset of ML that creates new content like text, audio, and images.  

## Detailed Notes  

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)  
- Example: A self-driving car making decisions like a human driver.  
  - Tasks include navigating traffic, detecting pedestrians, and making safe lane changes.  
- **AI** refers to the broader concept of machines or systems performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  

### Machine Learning (ML)  
- Example: A spam email filter that learns to detect spam based on user interaction and email content.  
- **ML** is a subset of AI that develops algorithms enabling machines to learn from data.  
- Algorithms are defined as specific sets of rules, mathematical equations, or procedures a model follows to learn and make predictions.  

### Deep Learning (DL)  
- Example: Image recognition software identifying objects or animals, like cats in photos.  
- **DL** is a subfield of ML that uses **neural networks with many layers** (deep neural networks).  
- These networks learn and understand complex data patterns.

### Types of Machine Learning  

#### 1. Supervised Learning  
- Algorithm learns from **labeled data** to make predictions or classifications.  
- Example: Credit card approval process.  
  - Manual or rules-based process is slow and needs skilled people.  
  - Rules keep changing but provide insights into decision-making.  
  - Instead, past credit card approval history (examples) can be used to train a model.  
- Process:  
  1. Collect past approval data.  
  2. Train a model using an algorithm that updates incrementally with data samples.  
  3. Use trained model to predict new outcomes.  
- This is called **supervised machine learning** — learning from labeled data.  

#### 2. Unsupervised Learning  
- Data has **no specific label** or outcome.  
- Goal: Discover trends and group similar data into clusters.  
- Examples:  
  - **Retail marketing and sales:** Grouping households by size, income, location, or occupation into clusters like “small family” or “high spender.”  
  - **Streaming services:** Clustering viewing data such as session length, minutes watched, or number of shows.  
  - **Fruits and vegetables nutrition:** Grouping nutritional data to identify similarities and design healthier diets.  
- Unsupervised learning drives insights by clustering and pattern discovery.  

#### 3. Reinforcement Learning  
- Learning approach where agents make decisions through **trial and error**, receiving feedback.  
- Example: Learning to play chess by making moves, checking outcomes, and adjusting based on memory of past results.  
- Used in:  
  - Autonomous car driving  
  - Robotics  
- Reinforcement learning teaches agents decision-making by interaction and feedback.

### Neural Networks & Deep Learning  
- Neural networks: Layers of connected "neurons," similar to brain cells.  
- They are an example of supervised ML, best understood in the context of **functional approximation**.  
- **Functional approximation:** Estimating hidden functions using past or current domain-specific data.  
- Applications:  
  - Identifying images of cats or dogs using raw pixels.  
  - Extracting features and rules automatically from raw data.  

### Generative AI  
- A subset of machine learning.  
- Creates new content such as text, audio, images, etc.  
- Works by learning patterns from existing data.  
- Example: ChatGPT generates text responses from patterns in trained text data.  
- Plays a key role in AI tasks that require content creation and innovation.

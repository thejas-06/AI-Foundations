# What is Artificial Intelligence? - Learning Notes  

## Overview  
This lesson explains **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** by comparing it to human intelligence.  
It covers:  
- What human intelligence enables us to do  
- The concept of **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**  
- How AGI leads to AI when applied to narrow objectives  
- Examples of AI in daily life  
- Why AI is important and the reasons we need it  
- Domains of AI with examples

## Detailed Notes  

### 1. Defining Artificial Intelligence  
- AI = Machines imitating human cognitive abilities and problem-solving.  
- **Human intelligence** allows us to:  
  - Learn new skills through observation and mental digestion  
  - Understand abstract concepts and apply reasoning  
  - Communicate using language and interpret nonverbal cues (facial recognition, tone, body language)  
  - Handle objections in real-time, even in complex settings  
  - Plan for short- and long-term goals/projects  
  - Create music, art, or invent new ideas

### 2. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)  
- If machines replicate these **human capabilities**, this is **AGI**.  
- **AGI abilities**:  
  - Mimic human sensory and motor skills  
  - Perform tasks using intelligence and learning  
  - Carry out complicated tasks without human intervention  

- When AGI is applied to **specific, narrow objectives**, it becomes **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

### 3. Examples of AI in Daily Life  
- Identifying an image/object (e.g., apple vs. orange)  
- Classifying email as spam or not spam  
- Writing computer code  
- Predicting the price of an older car

### 4. Why We Need AI  
- **Reason 1**: Handle massive data beyond human ability to absorb and analyze.  
- **Reason 2**: Improve speed and effectiveness of human efforts.  

#### Two Major Needs for AI:  
1. **Eliminate/reduce routine tasks**:  
   - Examples: approving credit cards/bank loans, processing insurance claims, recommending products.  
2. **A smart companion for creativity**:  
   - Examples: creating stories, poems, designs, code, music, and humor.

### 5. AI Domains and Examples  
- **Language** → translation  
- **Vision** → image classification  
- **Speech** → text-to-speech  
- **Product Recommendations** → cross-selling products  
- **Anomaly Detection** → detecting fraudulent transactions  
- **Learning by Reward** → self-driven cars  
- **Forecasting** → weather forecasting  
- **Generative AI** → generating content like images from text

## Summary  
Artificial Intelligence is the ability of machines to imitate human cognitive and problem-solving skills.  
- Human intelligence allows reasoning, communication, planning, and creativity.  
- Machines replicating these abilities fully are called **AGI**; applying AGI to narrow tasks is **AI**.  
- AI is already present in daily life through classification, prediction, spam detection, and automation.  
- The two main reasons we need AI are to **eliminate routine tasks** and to **act as a creative, intelligent partner**.  
- Domains of AI span across **language, vision, speech, recommendations, anomaly detection, learning by reward, forecasting, and content generation**.
